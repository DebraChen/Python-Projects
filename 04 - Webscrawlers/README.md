## Webs crawlers

I installed selenium and beautifulsoup4 to write web crawlers, it works on well some webs(Chinese douban book website, google scholar), but it could not deal with links that link to PDFs.
I'm still working on it to build a useful basic tool for myself, will make it better gradually

The plan is to practice to get some more infos from different online librabrys or news pages, and use letters that I grabed, transfering in to moresecode.(use part of the 03 poem game's code)
After that, will see if will use rasberry pie or sound to output the info from books or news, so it could be called 'book's talk', or 'message is talking'
