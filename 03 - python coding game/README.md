## Morse Poem

It is the game that I made after playing the 'python challenges'.

I used morse code to hide some secret feelings in my songs, it could remind me how I feels when I was writing the song. 
By overwriting some code, we could make our own 'code' to write about our feelings and mind. With the solution code, this work would be easier. 
Maybe no one else would even notice or decode them, But I'd say it could be a way to talk to ourselves.
